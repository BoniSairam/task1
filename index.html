He excelled in the emotional scenes in the second half."[42] Writing for Rediff.com, Radhikha Rajamani stated that "Arjun performs well though he is rather subdued."[43] Allu Arjun won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second Nandi Special Jury Award.

The film revolved around the complexities of love–hate relationships and love triangles.[44] His character in the film had shades of grey.[45] Sify wrote that "Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy caught in the powerful current of love.

His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes."[71][72] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007).
